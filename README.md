## Project Overview üìù

This project showcases a deep understanding of key computer science and software engineering principles, including:

- **Socket Programming in Java**: Leveraging Java's networking capabilities to handle client-server communication efficiently.
- **Thread Pools**: Utilizing thread pools to manage multiple client connections concurrently, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **Synchronization and Thread Locks**: Ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions through proper synchronization techniques.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Implementing consistent hashing to achieve a balanced distribution of requests, even when the number of servers changes dynamically.
- **Dynamic Weighted Round Robin Strategy**: Employing an advanced load balancing strategy to allocate requests based on server weights, adapting to varying server capacities and workloads.

## Features üåü

- **Efficient Request Handling**: Capable of managing thousands of simultaneous connections through optimized socket programming and thread pooling.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to accommodate increasing traffic and additional servers.
- **High Availability**: Ensures continuous service availability by intelligently distributing load and managing server failures.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Adapts to changing server conditions and workloads using consistent hashing and dynamic weighted round robin strategies.
